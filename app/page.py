        """Cancer treatment can be very expensive, and even with insurance coverage, out-of-pocket costs can quickly accumulate and become 
        unmanageable. This can lead to financial strain, bankruptcy, and other negative outcomes for patients and their families. Research 
        has shown that over 40% of patients diagnosed with cancer will declare personal bankruptcy within four years of their diagnosis. 
        This is a significant problem that has a major impact on the lives of cancer patients and their families. There are many factors that 
        contribute to the high costs of cancer treatment. These include the cost of drugs and other treatments, the cost of hospital stays 
        and other medical services, and the cost of travel and other related expenses. Additionally, patients may need to take time off work 
        or reduce their work hours to undergo treatment, which can further impact their financial situation. The financial burden of cancer 
        treatment can also have negative impacts on patient outcomes. Patients who experience financial stress may be more likely to delay 
        or forego treatment, which can lead to poorer outcomes and higher healthcare costs in the long run. Patients who declare bankruptcy 
        may also experience psychological distress, which can further impact their overall health and well-being. Overall, the financial 
        burden of cancer treatment is a significant problem that affects a large number of patients and their families. Finding ways to 
        reduce this burden and help patients proactively plan for out-of-pocket costs is an important area of research that has the potential 
        to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of negative financial outcomes for those undergoing cancer treatment. The development 
        of a predictive model for cancer treatment costs has the potential to significantly reduce the financial burden of a cancer diagnosis 
        on patients."""
